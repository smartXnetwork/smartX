## What is smartX?

smartX is a virtual currency, wallet and economic system that lets you tokenize and trade anything i.e. URLs/digital goods. 

For instance, using smartX an automated 24/7 liquid market üí∞ for a tweet can be created and its tokens can be traded by simply commenting "@smartXbot buy # tokens"

As investor or curator you benefit by buying tokens early. With increasing demand token price goes up and you can exit a market at any point by burning your tokens in the pool.

smartX's end goal is to build a smart socio-economic layer - with core features such as money, assets, feed, identity, social graph, reputation in one place - to let you seamlessly create, discover, manage and trade any kind of smart items (so called tokens) with built-in dynamic pricing, profit distribution, governance rules and compliance mechanism.

In other words, you will be able to create vanilla payments to equity like programmable/digital representation for any good/URL; enabling true value modularization.

## Why it matters? 

World economy is ruled by intermediaries - companies, governments, banks - with too much power and incentives in the hands of a few; making only rich, richer.

Value creation opportunities have been limited for average joe and far too much value is lost due to inefficiency created by poor and complex socio-economic models such as inflationary monetary policies, unaccountable governance, bureaucratic red tapes, interface proliferation to name a few.

"The last crisis did not hit us despite the presence of our monetary and financial authorities. It hit us because of them."

Let's change this.

What the world needs now is ‚Äúsocial capitalism‚Äù where everyone has an opportunity to be a solopreneur on top of a unified social-economic platform.

smartX's mission is to build a smart socio-economic system to power future of work that simplifies lives, unlocks new economic opportunities and gives power back to the people.

Building a world where you get freedom from bureaucracy, freedom from 9-5, freedom from monopolies, freedom from borders and more!

A smart, truly digital system which organizes core features of our life into simple open protocol systems will generate more economic benefits through modularization of value.

As internet's socio-economic üí∏ layer, smartX will help you invest in a tweet, trade memes on reddit, buy a photo on insta, watch a premium video on youtube, pay to chat on messenger, purchase in-game commodities or simply tip on anyone's blog.

smartX is for everyone - it bridges the gap between creators, curators, consumers and market makers through a smart open economy where each bit of granular value is tokenized. Anyone can become a collaborator, investor and winner in this new world through nothing but their skills.

Imagine value unlocked by such digitization: original creators get royalty, curators, fans &amp; market makers get to own &amp; invest in future, consumers get better discovery and much more

If internet and social media helped create value, smartX will help capture and exchange value. 


## How does it work?

<b>Universal Token & Transfer Protocol (UTTP)</b>

Under the hood smartX uses generic curved bonding structure for pricing and minting tokens, and creating automated markets based on universal token &amp; transfer protocol.

When someone buys that token not only they own that item but also automatically benefit from baked in incentives and follow associated regulatory mechanism.

Here's a slightly more detailed visual representation of how smartX's proposed universal token and transfer protocol will tie everything together. 

<img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DqGhu86UUAETHGw.jpg" class=" b-loaded">

0/ URL/Underlying good - e.g. photos, memes, tweets, music/audio, videos/movies, blogs/newsletters, licenses, tickets, in-game commodities, predictions, agreements, projects, artwork, trophies, fan cards, services, physical items, identities...

1/ Pricing and supply mechanism - e.g. fixed, free, varying...

2/ Incentive pool structure - e.g. creator/founder %, collaborators %, vendors %, investors %, consumers %, validator %, tax %...

3/ Governance and Compliance rules - e.g. voting provisions, dispute arbitration, witness signatures, regulatory approvals, decision making, burn/usage restrictions, identity verifications, tax filing...

Because of this seamless digitization, the platform is essentially capable of modularizing economic value for anything.

Best part is, smartX's decentralized experience is designed to complement ü§ùexisting infrastructure; making the UX absolutely frictionless for all parties. No learning curve, no gas fees, no KYC on exchanges, no key management. Just simple and fun value exchange. ‚úåÔ∏è

<b>Client features</b>

People can explore a market feed of amazing tokens/smartItems curated with real-time price information. They can share, watch or discuss any token to gauge its potential and learn more about its future growth.

After analyzing any token people can buy/invest a little or a lot depending on their appetite. As investor you earn by buying tokens early. With increasing demand, price per token goes up.

smartCoin serves as the underlying in-game currency to enable this experience. smartCoins are only minted at a transparent rate when a new member joins the network and used for making transactions for zero fee. 

People can store their tokens in wallet where they can track price movements and profit for each token and exit a market at any given point by burning their tokens.

smartX provides a secure and simple native identity with built in digital signatures to verify yourself and showcase your collection to public. It can bring your other social identities in one place too.

Chat helps people consolidate their social graph and connect with friends, family and world from one place using interactive rich cards.

smartScore acts as an underlying reputation metric of participants depending on quality of contributions in the network. This helps network reward and punish good and bad actors.

<b>High level technical architecture</b>

Anyone will be able to act as a validator üì¢&nbsp;(to verify users and process txns) by running smartX core and participate in light touch (D)PoS style consensus model (% requests processed ~= % network coins staked) on IPFS. 

## What about monetary economics and game theory?

Monetary supply is fixed but unlike other hard cryptocurrencies it's given directly to people and only minted at a transparent rate when a new member (referred/verified by existing member) joins network.

Early you join more you get per natural log based token minting function.

Not only it makes experience frictionless &amp; viral but also offers a fair way to distribute money. I can tell right now how much a billionth member will get with certainty!

With this model we're pretty much guaranteed to see supply proportional to network growth / utility.

Validators mint certain % when they admit a verified member to the network and charge additional % as txn fee from creator profits. Successful verifiers/challengers get some % from the PoS pool as well. 


## What is the vision and roadmap?

We see a world in 2025 where people have real freedom to do what they want - future of work in a smart economy where billions of people, solopreneurs, service providers and teams come together seamlessly in one free open market and exchange any kind of information or service they love in a self sovereign way.

Let's turn world into a totally public owned and managed direct liquid democracy.

## How to get involved?

smartX is meant to be open source/DAO with a suite of simple protocols to build a smart, truly digital economy. Anyone who wants to give real freedom and power back to people is welcome to join and contribute to the endeavor. 

There's a LOT of work to do üë©&zwj;üíª and with current PoC (to be launched soon) we've taken first üë∂ steps. We need passionate folks - from applied cryptographers to economists to distributed systems experts to full stack /mobile developers to marketers - who can help with the mission.

Really want this to be a community effort so even if you're slightly intrigued (or pissed) don't hesitate to reach out to me (@abh1manyu) with your comments / feedback / ideas. 

These are some very early üê£ thoughts and I'm sure things will evolve after discussing with folks smarter than me.
